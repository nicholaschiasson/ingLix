English done right.

Opinionated, better English spelling.

## Preamble

<details>

<summary>Click to expand.</summary>

The English language is _wrought_ with inconsistent uses of letters in the alphabet for spelling out sounds. This is a source of confusion for just about everyone who has ever read and written any amount of English, learners and native speakers alike.

Imagine reading some text and coming across a word you haven't yet learned. In elementary schools in Canada, children are taught to "sound it out" in order to make an educated guess as to what the word might be based on some rules about generally how letters should sound. This works in a handful of cases, but becomes less useful for more complex words. There are exceptions to seemingly every rule, and for many words it almost seems as if the metaphorical _authors of the English language_, God rest their souls, were absolutely inebriated when coming up with these arbitrary spellings.

Now imagine writing an essay and believing that you have a vast vocabulary amongst your peers, when suddenly you try to write the word "written", as I had just done two paragraphs ago, and you need to stop to think about whether the word has one or two "t"s. "Sound it out..." I hear the faint memory of my grade one school teacher whisper, but frankly that doesn't help in this case. Does a double "t" _ever_ change the sound of the word in English? Does it actually matter? Okay, so google tells me it has two "t"s. Great, but then why does "writing" and "writer" only have one...? The difference in pronunciation, if any, is negligible (this could be my own accent at work though, your mileage may vary).

I could keep going though. What about other words like "gauge"? Why is that spelled that way? What part does that "u" actually play? I hear this word quite often actually at work and just about every non-native speaker pronounces the it more like "gowge". This is intuition. I agree it should be pronounced that way given its spelling. But it's now. I don't usually correct people on this because I don't want to be annoying about something that doesn't matter that much. But English, you're putting me in a tough spot here!

What about all of these "ough" sounds that are all _over_ the place? I mean seriously: "rough", "though", "through", "cough", "drought"! Enough is enough (:wink:)! That's five different pronunciations for the same four letter combination! This is only the tip of the iceberg though. English is riddled with weird spellings. The ones I've mentioned so far have been quite tame if I'm being honest.

Of course, I understand that the origin story of the modern written English language is hairy and complex, and I understand that things will never really change. We need our systems to allow us to preserve our history. We need to keep as much information as accessible as possible. What that means is that we're stuck with the broken system, and probably for a long, long time. I have no real problem with that. My complaints are real, but exaggerated.

In spite of all of that, I am starting this project as somewhat of a casual experiment to try to "fix" the English writing system. Somehow, this kind of thing is fun to me, and I think I actually have something quite nicely crafted so far.

The goal is simple: repurpose the letters in the English alphabet to make more sense. Simplify. Remove redundancy. Make it truly possible to "sound it out" with more confidence. I want to redefine the mappings from letters of the alphabet to possible sounds in the English language so that anybody can read or write with relative ease.

Of course it goes without saying that this will be quite opinionated. The dictionary will be entirely based on my accent (Standard Canadian). It's entirely possible though that the system may be easily transposable to other accents. I guess time will tell.

So if you read through the first sentence of this preamble and thought to yourself, "Hmmm... what is this word, 'W-R-O-U-G-H-T'...? OHH... 'ROT'! I see. Didn't know that's how you spelled that word. :thinking:" then buckle up because this project is for _YOU_! We're about to fix English and there is no turning back!

## Graphemes

Graphemes are the written representations of the units of sound we can make when speaking, also known as phonemes. In other words, a grapheme is the letter(s) we use to represent a sound.

We will divide the list of English phonemes into two sets, [pure](#pure-graphemes) and [composite](#composite-graphemes), and assign inglix graphemes to those.

We will consider a pure phoneme to be an atomic sound in which the mouth shape remains relatively unchanged or steady for the duration of the sound.

Logically and as the name implies, we will consider composite phonemes to be sounds composed of more than one pure phoneme.

This distinction is useful since inglix aims to only address all pure phonemes, mapping a single letter to each possible pure phoneme. Conversely, the English writing system is inconsistent and commonly represents composite phonemes using single letters (case in point, the word "I"). The composite phonemes are listed to provide examples of how they are to be represented in inglix.

### Pure Graphemes

#### Vowels

##### Short Vowels

| IPA Symbol | Common English Grapheme(s) | inglix Grapheme | English Example | inglix egzampl |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| æ | a | a | cat, bag, fan[^1] | kat, bag, fan |
| e | e | e | leg | leg |
| ɪ | i | i | sit | sit |
| ɒ | o | o | top | top |
| ʊ | oo, u, o, ou | u | book, put, wolf, would | buk, put, wulf, wud |
| ʌ | u | V | rub | rVb |

[^1]: Depending on a speaker's accent, the words "cat", "bag", and "fan", as well as many other words with short "a" vowels, may all have slightly different sounds. The inglix system will not attempt to address these differences, but only for the case of the short "a" vowel sound. Consider this your final taste of freedom of expression before inglix takes it all away...

##### Long Vowels

It is commonly considered that there are 5 long vowels but the "ie"/"igh" sound is very clearly a composition of two different vowels. Thus it is omitted from the list of [pure](#pure-graphemes) phonemes and instead listed as a [composite](#composite-graphemes) phoneme.

| IPA Symbol | Common English Grapheme(s) | inglix Grapheme | English Example | inglix egzampl |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| i | ee, ea | I | bee, beat | bI, bIt |
| oʊ | oe, ow | O[^2] | toe, flow | tO, flO |
| u | oo, ue | U | moon, cue | mUn, kIU |

[^2]: This is actually a special case vowel in that it is actually a composite sound, but since the first part of the sound is not representable alone, we specially give it a single letter as the grapheme.

##### R-Controlled Vowels

These are special case vowel sounds that are only made in English when followed immediately by the letter "r".

As with long vowels, there are commonly considered more r-controlled vowels than inglix will bother with. In inglix "ar" and "or" sounds are trivial and can be represented using composition (see the [composite graphemes](#composite-graphemes) below).

| IPA Symbol | Common English Grapheme(s) | inglix Grapheme | English Example | inglix egzampl |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| ɜr | er, ir, ur | yr | her, bird, hurt | hyr, byrd, hyrt |

#### Vowels

| IPA Symbol | Common English Grapheme(s) | inglix Grapheme | English Example | inglix egzampl |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| b | b | b | bet | bet |
| tʃ | ch | c | chain | ceIn |
| d | d | d | dip | dip |
| f | f | f | fan | fan |
| ɡ | g | g | gap | gap |
| ʒ | ge, z, si, j | J | beige, azure, vision | beIJ, aJyr, viJin |
| h | h | h | hat | hat |
| dʒ | j | j | Jane | jeIn |
| k | k, c | k | cap | kap |
| l | l | l | leg | leg
| m | m | m | met | met |
| n | n | n | net | net |
| p | p | p | pet | pet |
| r | r | r | rat | rat |
| s | s | s | sue | sU |
| ʃ | sh | x | ship | xip |
| t | t | t | tip | tip |
| θ | th | S[^3] | thin | Sin |
| ð | th | T | this | Tis |
| v | v | v | van | van |
| w | w | w[^4] | wet | wet |
| j | y | Y[^5] | yak | Yak |
| z | z | z | zoo | zU |

[^3]: This may seem to be a bizarre choice of grapheme for the unvoiced "th" sound. The fact is that it was chosen because a stereotypical "s" lisp makes this sound. So why not use capital "S" to represent it?

[^4]: There was a case to be made against "w" being included in inglix. Instead, it could have probably simply been replaced by the inglix "U". This would be similar to how the French language uses "ou" in place of the "w" sound (for native French words). Given that, "w" is somewhat elegant and intuitive, and using a "U" in its place might confuse readers into emphasizing the "U" sound making some words sound awkward. Lowercase "w" can stay.

[^5]: Like "w", the same goes for the "y" sound. This could have probably been replaced by the inglix "I" but it would likely serve more to confuse readers and also force over-emphasis in some places. Since "y" is already reserved for the "er" sound via "yr", the capital version will have to suffice.

### Composite Graphemes

These are primarily for example purposes. Some of the composites listed below are self-evident and only listed due to the fact that they are commonly treated as unique phonemes but in practice sound indistinguishable from their parts. However, there are a few items in the list below which are perhaps good to note, such as the "ie"/"igh" long vowel sound and the "ng" sound.

| IPA Symbol | Common English Grapheme(s) | inglix Grapheme | English Example | inglix egzampl |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| aɪ | ie, igh | aI | pie, high | paI, haI |
| eɪ | ai, ay | eI | paid, tray | peId, creI |
| ɑr | ar | or | car | kor |
| ɔr | or | Or | cork | kOrk |
| aʊ | ow, ou | aU | cow, out | kaU, aUt |
| ɔɪ | oy, oi | OI | boy, void | bOI, vOId |
| ɪər | eer, ear | Ir | deer, near | dIr nIr |
| er | air, ere | er | hair, there | her, Ter |
| ur | our | Ur | tour | tUr |
| ŋɡ | ng | ng[^6] | sing, tongue | sing, tung |
| ŋk | nk | nk | pink | pink |
| ks | x | ks | box | boks |
| kw | qu | kw | quit | kwit |

[^6]: It can be said that the "ng" (as well as "nk") sound makes a completely different mouth shape compared to the solitary "n" sound, and thus inglix should not use the letter "n" in this composite grapheme. However, given that the sound without the "g" is very difficult to make in isolation and not used in English very much if at all, "ng" fits well as a sufficient and intuitive solution for the sound. After all, the more inglix can resemble English after trimming the fat, the better.

## Homonyms

To express homonyms, inglix chooses a unique approach. This is where the trivia starts to emerge.

The inglix dictionary will identify homonyms uniquely by duplicating the first letter of the word for each instance of a homonym.

Take the words "to", "too", and "two", for example.

In inglix, we might write these as "tU", "ttU", and "tttU", respectively. It will be up to you to remember "wic wwic iz wic" (which witch is which). However since it is uncommon for there to be more than 3 homonyms for a given sounding word, this approach seems quite clean and elegant being the only case of double letters in all of inglix.

## Syntax

The inglix writing system is made for writing English. Therefore, it works basically the same way! However, there are some key differences to take note of!

### Casing

In inglix, you do not capitalize the first letter of a sentence of even those of proper nouns! Every version of a letter, that is to say uppercase and lowercase, is reserved intentionally to express words phonetically. This allows for inglix to be much, much simpler than English, and even strip down the alphabet a good deal.

Perhaps the best way to get started reading and writing inglix is to not think of letters in terms of uppercase and lowercase anymore at all, but rather as a set of unique letters each with a resulting sound (some of which happen to only be accessible via another letter on the keyboard in tandem with the shift key :grinning_face_with_sweat:)
